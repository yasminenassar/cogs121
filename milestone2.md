## Changes Made
In milestone 2, we began to create the skeleton of our web application, Weddit. 
There are a couple of things that we had to change, that were originally in our paper
prototypes. Initially, we wanted to have a mood board where the user could save 
photos as inspiration for their wedding ideas. However, we decided to focus on other
features like budget, checklist, and vendor search. We will be using the instagram 
API to output posts to the user when they search for vendors. All in all, the 
skeleton of the web app mostly followed the paper prototypes we submitted for 
milestone 1.
