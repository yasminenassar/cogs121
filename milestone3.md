## UI Skeleton Screenshots
Screenshots of our new UI and how they are different than milestone 2.

![Login Page](static_files/pics/milestone3/login.png)
We applied our new theme here and to every page: new colors, and an easier (and
prettier) navigation bar. It'll change colors when you hover over a specific
tag.

![Home Page](static_files/pics/milestone3/home.png)
The home page has now all been centered, the colors have been changed. There is a tab navigation bar as well.

![Checklist Page](static_files/pics/milestone3/checklist.png)
On the checklist sheet, the theme was applied again.  We still plan to change the buttons to be prettier.

![Search Page](static_files/pics/milestone3/search1.png)
The colors and nav bar were added here. Hover over the Vendors tab to search for
a certain vendor. 

![Results Page](static_files/pics/milestone3/search2.png)
This page shows what the results of the vendor search once you select what vendor you want to search for. These are the options that come up for makeup artist, generated by yelp.

![Budget Page](static_files/pics/milestone3/budget.png)
On the budget sheet, the theme was applied, but we still plan on fixing it up
more.

![Profile Page](static_files/pics/milestone3/profile.png)
The theme was applied here, same as the other pages. The boxes for the user to input all of their information is also now centered, which is a little easier on the eyes aesthetically.
