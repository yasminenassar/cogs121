## Project Idea
Our app aims to create a one-stop app for all of the brides-to-be’s needs. Without a wedding planner, planning an entire wedding can be super difficult, as there are so many things to keep track of. Once you get the venue and date locked in, you still may have to book a makeup artist, photographer, videographer, among other things. Brides want to be able to filter for the budget of the vendor, the distance of the vendor from the venue, and look through the previous work of that vendor. In this app, they can do just that - search and book vendors, contact and find vendors’ instagrams, keep track of their wedding budget, find images off of pinterest/instagram that they can save in a ‘wedding mood board,’ and keep a checklist of remaining tasks left before their wedding.

For the scope of this project, we’d like to focus on (1) searching for makeup artists and photographers (which will consist of filtering for their location and availability among other filters, and links to their instagram accounts), (2) maintaining a budget sheet, (3) keep a checklist of remaining tasks, (4) have a countdown until the wedding and progress bar of completed items, and lastly, if we have enough time, allow users to create boards via pinterest and instagram.

This fits the theme because we are designing for people very different than ourselves - brides. None of us are planning to get married any time soon, thus, we wouldn’t be in the audience of our own app.

### Paper Prototype #1

First page shown to user is the sign in/up page.

Then, set up your profile by filling out where and when your wedding will take place, among other details.
![make your profile](profile.jpg)


You will then be taken to your home page, where you can view the countdown until your wedding (not
drawn but will also include: progress bar of tasks completed)
![home](home.jpg)


After pressing 'Budget' Tab:
First view of the budget page - you'll see a pop up that indicates you should
put in a budget for each of your vendors.

### Paper Prototype #2

First page shown to user is the sign in/up page.
![sign in](signin.jpg)


You will then be taken to your home page, where you can view the countdown until your wedding (not
drawn but will also include: progress bar of tasks completed). The tabs are now
on the bottom (like Instagram), and also appear as logos rather than words. 
![home](home2.jpg)


When you press on the magnifying class icon, you can search for a vendor
![search2](search2.jpg)

In the same way as prototype 1, once you press makeup artist, you'll be asked filtering questions to narrow your
search results
![filters](filters.jpg)


You'll be taken to your vendor search results once you press 'Filter' in the
previous screen.
![vendor search result](searchresult.jpg)


When you press on the '+' Tab, you can view which tasks you've completed
and which tasks are remaining, as well as add a task. 
![checklist](check2.jpg)


(not for sure a feature - will only be implemented if time permits) When you press on the Heart tab, 
you can view your mood boards and add to them by searching for hashtags and
saving posts.

After pressing '$' tab, view your budget sheet and add to it.
