## Changes Made
In milestone 2, we began to create the skeleton of our web application, Weddit. 
There are a couple of things that we had to change, that were originally in our paper
prototypes. Initially, we wanted to have a mood board where the user could save 
photos as inspiration for their wedding ideas. However, we decided to focus on other
features like budget, checklist, and vendor search. We will be using the instagram 
API to output posts to the user when they search for vendors. For example, if a
user wants to find a makeup artist, we will create hashtags using their wedding
venue's location (we have that information already when the couple creates an
account), and the vendor they want (ie, #SanFranciscoMakeupArtist), and then
output the posts that have that hashtag. Then, the user can look through these
posts, and find vendors they like. All in all, the skeleton of the web app mostly 
followed the paper prototypes we submitted for milestone 1.  
 

## UI Skeleton Screenshots
Our two main screens that we chose to implement are the home page (index.html)
and the budget page (budget.html).

![Login Page](static_files/pics/login.png)
The log in page in the skeleton was inspired by out paper prototype.It is mostly the same. We do not have a logo creates yet, however we intend to add that by the name of our app at the top of the page once it is created. And instead of having a sign in or sign up button like we did in the paper prototype, we have a login button for people who want to sign in and an option for those who do not have an account, to create one. 

![Create Account Page](static_files/pics/create.png)
Initially, in our paper prototype we were asking the user to input all of their profile information on one screen. This was very overwhelming for a user at first. Rather in our skeleton we decided to just have the user set up their email and password, then when they hit create account, they will be able to input the rest of the information they need for their profile.

![Home Page](static_files/pics/home.png)
The home page here is very similar to the paper prototype except that we do not have the feature that will countdown to the day of the couple's wedding.

![Checklist Page](static_files/pics/checklist.png)
The checklist page in our skeleton is identical to the checklist page we have in our paper prototypes.

![Search Page](static_files/pics/search.png)
The vendor search page is also identical to the vendor search page we have in our paper prototype.

![Budget Page](static_files/pics/budget.png)
The budget page here is very similar to that in the paper prototypes. We decided to have the total budget, budget spent, and budget remaining on their own, rather than with the vendor list, budget, and what was actually spent.

![Profile Page](static_files/pics/editprofile.png)
The edit profile tab is one that we did not have in our paper prototypes. It is a feature we decided to add upon creating the skeleton.
